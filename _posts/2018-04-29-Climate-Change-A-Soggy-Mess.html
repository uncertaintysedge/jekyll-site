<span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Innovation has allowed humans to become less concerned with natural survival, and more concerned with progress and leisure. People live in climate-controlled homes and vehicles working for money to make purchases instead of scavenging and living in the elements. This disconnection has made the outdoors a human luxury. In the fast, walled up modern world, a walk down the street, a vacation to the woods or the beach, or a game out in the field is freeing, and most people have some kind of pet who is loved as a family member, a part of the outdoors that has been brought indoors. Innovation has changed human life in several ways. It eliminated the primal need to survive for survival’s sake, bringing people indoors and disconnecting people from the outdoors, while simultaneously catering certain natural aspects to the human ambience. But at what cost? Human luxury can largely be called human pollution. Not only are air and water being directly contaminated, but the world’s climate is also changing as a direct result of human pollution: melting glaciers, ruining habitats, changing weather patterns, and consequently harming the Earth’s plant and animal life (climate.nasa.gov). This is damage to the very Earth that innovation has given us such strange relations to, damage to the fresh air and plants and animals that people have grown to love. Animals and plants cannot simply step inside, crank up the air conditioning, get some ice water from the fridge, and ignore the rising temperatures. They are directly impacted by the environmental effects of careless, convenience-driven human pollution.</span></div>
<div class="c1" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 2; padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
<span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The mere thought of leaving the cat without food for several days or leaving a puppy outside in the rain for an evening is devastating to most people. Yet, when it comes to foreign and local wildlife whose food, water, and shelter are being ruined by climate change, the suffering of animals is suddenly easy to ignore. Even though most people have not developed strong relationships with hippos, or even squirrels for that matter, the suffering of these animals should be treated no differently from that of a house cat, except, possibly, in that it is more extreme. People need to acknowledge what is happening.</span></div>
<div class="c1" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 2; padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
<span class="c4" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">One creature that most people are familiar with, but may only see on occasion is the frog. I have many memories of catching frogs with my mom and my grandma in small streams and swamps in the eastern Oregon mountains, and very few nights pass unaccompanied by frogs in a croaking nighttime chorus outside the tents on camping trips with the Boy Scouts. Even in my own bed at home there are nights when frogs can be heard in nearby ponds, their low rumble and high intervals assisting in the night time ambience. Frogs are commonly known to be amphibians, meaning they have a gilled larval stage, and they do a large amount of their breathing through their skin, so they thrive in wet areas (www.shsu.edu). For Oregon frogs this is mostly marshes, small streams and, simply, damp forest soil (myodfw.com). This means frogs in general are highly susceptible to climate change. Due to climate change, m</span><span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">ore than half of intermediate wetlands are estimated to become irregular and dry-up by 2080 in the Pacific Northwest (www.oregonzoo.org). Such irreversible damage is horrible, but, more frightening still, are the effects of climate change that are happening now, close to home.</span></div>
<div class="c1" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 2; padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
<span class="c4" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">Oregon frogs take refuge in marshes, small streams, and damp forest soil (myodfw.com). Unfortunately, for the past 40 years these sylvan locations have been subjected to worsening wildfires, with fire season growing from five months to more than seven, burning 665,000 acres in 2017 (oregonforests.org). These fires have human and natural causes, but their increased activity is largely due to climate change; temperatures rise, causing snowpacks to melt up to four weeks earlier and forests are drier for longer (www.ucsusa.org). During the fall of last year there were several days when the air condition from fires was so bad, outdoor sports were canceled in the Salem Keizer and Santiam school districts, where I attend school and play soccer. Growing up I would hear my parents and relatives talk about roads being closed and even needing to evacuate their homes due to smoke in eastern Oregon, which is horrible in itself, but never, to my memory, had the effects of the fires directly affected where I live. It is horrible to imagine how wildlife, whose homes fuel the fire, are eff</span><span class="c4" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;">ected, and it is even worse to imagine what wildfires are like for&nbsp;</span><span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">frogs and like creatures. Although some frogs are known to migrate between shallow breeding ponds and deeper bodies of water for the winter, they tend to do so on rainy or humid days to keep their amphibian skin moist, and most migration does not happen until they are ready to hibernate to avoid predation by fish (http://www.learner.org). In other words, if a frog is caught in a forest fire there is not much it can do to escape, and if it does there is not much the frog can do to survive once free from the flames. They cannot simply cancel sports practice to escape the smoke.</span></div>
<div class="c1" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 2; padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
<span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Frogs are a major part of sny ecosystem they inhabit. They provide food for countless predators, including fish, snakes, birds, and larger insects, as adults they prey on numerous amounts and varieties of insects, including mosquitoes, ticks, and flies that carry disease, and they feed on and maintain algae as tadpoles (youtu.be). Because frogs are so integral in their ecosystems, harming frogs and disrupting one part of the cycle can derail the whole thing (globalchange.umich.edu). For example, if frogs were to disappear from an ecosystem, the mosquito population would grow out of control, and disease would increase. In forest fires, frogs do not stand much of a chance, but even if they could survive, the frogs’ habitats are destroyed, so they still cannot survive in the end, and other creatures that do survive are greatly harmed, ruining the habitat further and causing declines in other species that have the same effect. The cycle is derailed, and all because one member of a habitat could not adapt to the effects of climate change.</span></div>
<div class="c1" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 2; padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt;">
<span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">In Oregon, frogs including the coastal tailed frog, the Rocky Mountain tailed frog, the northern red-legged frog, the Cascades frog, the Oregon spotted frog, the Columbia spotted frog, and the foothill yellow-legged frog are considered Oregon Conservative Strategy species (myodfw.com). That is seven species who have been considered in need of help through science and voluntary action because they have been noticeably harmed, and are not surviving at a natural rate. So what can be done? As seen, climate change is a major threat to frogs, ruining their habitats and throwing off weather patterns that they rely on for survival (climate.nasa.gov). Thus a good place to start in helping frogs is to simply be more environmentally aware, and tale personal steps to reduce carbon emissions which are causing climate change. In terms of transportation, consider driving an electric or hybrid vehicle, walking or riding a bike to travel shorter distances, or using public transport instead of a personal vehicle during a bumper to bumper commute. Simply live more consciously. Eating less processed foods, and large corporation meats and replacing them with more local produce can cut down on factory and mass livestock pollution (www.globalstewards.org). Try buying less unnecessary or throw away products, such as ziploc bags, paper napkins, or single use, seasonal decorations, instead buying reusable, quality items such as cloth shopping bags and napkins or glass tupperware, and when disposing of single-use items use the appropriate means, whether it is recycling, composting, or garbage (www.globalstewards.org). In addition to reducing carbon emmisions, frogs are threatened in other ways, and helping in these areas can also assist in their survival as a whole. This includes cutting down on the use of pesticides in food that infiltrate the frogs’ skin, dealing with invasive species that are competing with frogs in their shrinking habitats, and stopping the exploitation of frogs for human enjoyment in quite un-restricted trafficking of frogs for pets and frog legs (youtu.be).</span></div>

<span class="c3" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Innovation has provided humans with a strange relationship to nature, which has brought people indoors and disconnected them from the outdoors, all the while catering certain natural aspects to human ambience, and all at the cost of human pollution. This makes it difficult to take notice to the effects of climate change, especially on animal life, like frogs, that is an integral part of the environment, but may not be seen everyday. Moreover, it is difficult not to pollute it is a part of the innovation and American culture that makes up daily life. However, the difficulty of change is not the impossibility of change, and by living less wastefully, using the available, clean technologies, and avoiding thoughtless exploitation and harmful manipulation of the outdoors, the outdoors can be saved for humans and frogs alike.</span></div>
